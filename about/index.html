								<p>
								Have you had a dream that turned into Reality? or a plan that just happened? Well, this is why this web page is black and white. It is because all the places, the pictures, the videos  and the experiences you will see in this webpage was just a dream and was just a plan that is the reason why it is black and white. Until, i was lucky and blessed enough to have the opportunity to make all these dreams and plans make it to reality. The other reason that this webpage is mostly black is because my friends call me "Egoy" which means black =)

								<p>
								How did i get the opportunity and the chance to make all these dreams and plans come true? No, i am not rich nor i have a great job to be able to afford all these travel plans and adventures. No, my mom and dad does not pay for my trips (i wish, that would have been awesome!) but no they do not. Well, It was really a mixture of Luck, patience and a lot of change. 
								</p>

								<p>
								Let me start with Luck. when i said luck, it is because i have friends from all over the world  (literally). With that being said, we all know that one of the most expensive expense when we travel is the lodging part. So, having friends from different parts all over the world is definitely helpful, because you get to save a ton of money when you stay with your friends. and just use your money for other expenses, experiences and adventures. So make sure you keep in contact with your friends from all over the world.
								</p>

								<p>
								Patience is the second one i mentioned. We all know any big travel plans cannot just happen overnight (unless you are rich AF). but we need to be patient in terms of when the trip will happen, when is the best time to buy the ticket or when are your friends available to go with you. Tust me being patience with all of these things will save you a ton of money and it will help you to get to your destination in a very affordable way. We do not want to be broke after we go to our dream destination. So, we need to be patient.
								</p>

								<p>
								The last and most important one is CHANGE. If we really want to travel and make all these dreams happen, Is we need to change. Particulary with our spening habits. I have to admit, I used to buy a lot of things that i thought will make me happy or just to show off because i like when people compliment what im wearing (who does not like compliments, right?) it made me feel good about myself temporarily. Until i decided to make a change on myself, my perspective of what really is important in my life and what really makes me happy. That is when i was able to start making my dreams and plans happens. 
								</p>

								<p>
								I made this Webpage because i want to share my experiences, encourage and hopefully inspire all the people that will come across my webpage, to make their dreams and plans turn into reality.  (I feel like this is the part where i should say some travel quotes or share some words of wisdom.lol) im pretty sure all of us have our own favorite quotes and some words of wisdom. Mine is,"There is no force on Earth more powerful than the will to LIVE". So i thought that i need to share it,but other than that, if you have any questions, need some travel tips, want a tour guide or collaborate. you can just shoot me a message any social media on the side bar or use the contact page. Hope to hear from you soon and Thank you for stopping by.
